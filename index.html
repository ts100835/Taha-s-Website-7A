  <h1><em>Dinosaurs</em></h1>
    
  <h2><em>Introduction to Dinosaurs</em></h2>
  <p>Dinosaurs are some dangerou  s, and some friendly reptiles who lived for 140 million years lived 65 million years ago. They evolved from Shapes and sizes from outrageous Spinosaurs<br> to little chick-sized Microraptors. One thing that they were good at is surviving a variety of ecosystems.
  Dinosaurs had straight back legs, which are perpendicular to their legs. This let them to produce less energy to move compared to other reptiles that had a irregular stance like lizards and crocodiles and others that are still alive today.
  Their legs were also positioned under their bodies rather than sticking out to the side to support their weight better.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><em>The Triassic Period</em></h2>
  <p>At the time of the Triassic Period, all of the land and continents in the world were one big peice, instead of small divided plates like currently,
    called "Pangaea". The climte in the Triassic Period was mostly hot and dry, covered with large desserts. unlike today and beyond, there were no polar ice caps.

    <p>  As you can see here, this is a bone of a dinosaur caalled "Nyasasauraus". Scientists predict the this is a bone of one of the very first Dinosaurs.
  It was in this exact enviroment that the reptiles everyone knows, Dinosaurs, had first evolved. Reptiles tend to grow in hot and dry places
  because their skin is less pourous than, an example would be like mamoth skin, so it loses water in the heat. The kidneys of a reptile is better at conserving water.
  While it was gonna be the end of the Triassic period, there were series of earthquakes and mssive volcano erruptions causing pangaea to slowly break that one big peice into to peices of the land.
  At that ttime the split of the land had caused to give birth to the North Atlantic Ocean.</p><br>

  <h2><em>The Jurassic Period</em></h2>
  <p>At the end of the Triassic Period there was a mass extinction, the causes of which are still hotly debated. Many large land animals were wiped out but the dinosaurs survived, giving them the opportunity to evolve into a wide variety of forms and increase in number.</p>

  <p>Lush vegetation grew in the Jurassic Period, providing plenty of food for plant-eating dinosaurs, such as this Stegosaurus</p>
  <p>The single land mass, Pangaea, split into two, creating Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. Despite this separation, similarities in their fossil records show that there were some land connections between the two continents early in the Jurassic. These regions became more distinct later in the period.</p>
  <p>Temperatures fell slightly, although it was still warmer than today due to higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Rainfall increased as a result of the large seas appearing between the land masses.</p>
  <p>These changes allowed plants such as ferns and horsetails to grow over huge areas. Some of this vegetation became the fossil fuels that we mine today. Elsewhere there were forests of tall conifer trees such as sequoias and monkey puzzles.</p>

    <p>The large sauropod dinosaur Diplodocus lived in the Jurassic Period. Explore other dinosaurs from the Late Jurassic.</p>
    <p>The plentiful plant supply allowed the huge plant-eating sauropods - such as Apatosaurus, Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus - to evolve. These are some of the largest animals to have ever walked the Earth. By the end of the Jurassic their herds dominated the landscape.</p>

    <h2><em>Cretaceous Period</em></h2>
    <p>During the Cretaceous the land separated further into some of the continents we recognise today, although in different positions. This meant that dinosaurs evolved independently in different parts of the world, becoming more diverse.</p>
    <p>Sauropods reached their largest sizes in the Cretaceous. The biggest were the titanosaurs. Patagotitan was a staggering 37.5 metres long!</p>

    <p>Other groups of organisms also diversified. The first snakes evolved during this time, and by the end of the Cretaceous, flowering plants were a much more common part of Earth's plant life.</p>
    <p>Various insect groups also appeared, including bees, which helped increase the spread of flowering plants. And mammals now included tree climbers, ground dwellers and even predators of small dinosaurs.</p>

    <h2><em>Did you know?</em></h2>
    <p>Sea levels rose and fell repeatedly during the Cretaceous Period. At the highest point there were many shallow seas separating parts of the continents we know today. For example, Europe was made up of many smaller islands. Thick layers of sediment built up at the bottom of these seas as single-celled algae died and their skeletons fell to the seabed.</p>
    <p>This is how most of the chalk we use today was first formed. So much so, that 'Cretaceous' comes from the Latin word for chalk, 'creta'.</p>
